  "summary": "Both products are Vitamin C serums aimed at brightening the skin and fading dark spots. Product A offers a lower concentration at a more affordable price, making it suitable for those primarily looking to target dark spots on oily and combination skin. However, Product B provides a higher concentration of Vitamin C, additional beneficial ingredients such as Niacinamide and Green Tea Extract, and is suitable for a broader range of skin types, including normal and dry skin. It also boasts additional benefits like reducing fine lines and soothing the skin, making it a more comprehensive skincare solution despite the higher price.",
  "recommendation": "For users looking for an effective and affordable option specifically for oily or combination skin, Product A (GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum) is recommended. However, for those seeking a more powerful serum with additional skin benefits and suitable for various skin types, Product B (Radiance Plus Vitamin C Serum) would be the better choice, despite its higher price."

      "section_name": "Key Ingredients",
      "content": "**Ingredients**: Our GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum combines the power of two key ingredients to maximize your skincare results: 1. **Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid)**: Known for its antioxidant properties, Vitamin C helps brighten the skin and reduce the appearance of dark spots, leaving your complexion looking radiant and youthful. It also protects against environmental stressors while stimulating collagen production, which is essential for maintaining skin elasticity. 2. **Hyaluronic Acid**: This powerhouse ingredient acts as a humectant, drawing moisture into the skin and keeping it hydrated throughout the day. Hyaluronic Acid helps to plump the skin, reducing the appearance of fine lines and enhancing the overall texture, ensuring that your skin remains smooth and supple. Together, these ingredients create a synergistic effect for a healthier, glowing complexion."

      "content": "**Safety**: Our GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum is suitable for oily and combination skin types. However, as with any new skincare product, it’s advisable to perform a patch test prior to full application, especially for those with sensitive skin. Apply a small amount of serum on the inner wrist or behind the ear and wait 24 hours to check for any adverse reactions. Mild tingling may occur upon application, which is normal; however, if you experience significant irritation or redness, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist. Store in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to maintain the efficacy of the serum. Always follow up with sunscreen during the day to protect your skin from UV rays and prevent further pigmentation."

  "summary": "The GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum (Product A) has a slightly lower concentration of Vitamin C compared to the RadianceC Serum (Product B), but it is priced lower, making it more accessible for budget-conscious consumers. Product B, however, offers a broader range of benefits including hydration, redness reduction, and anti-aging properties, which may appeal more to those with normal to dry skin types. Both products contain Vitamin C, but Product B adds Niacinamide and Green Tea Extract, enhancing its overall skincare profile. In terms of skin type suitability, Product B caters to a wider audience, while Product A is more tailored to oily and combination skin types. In terms of value for money, Product A is slightly better due to its lower price point while still providing effective benefits.",
  "recommendation": "For users with oily or combination skin seeking a brightening serum at a lower price, GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum is a great choice. However, for those with normal to dry skin types looking for a more comprehensive serum with additional benefits such as hydration and anti-aging properties, the RadianceC Serum is recommended despite its higher price."

  "summary": "Product A offers a lower price point and is suitable for oily and combination skin, making it a more economical choice for those skin types. However, Product B, with a higher concentration of Vitamin C and a more comprehensive ingredient profile, provides additional benefits like hydration and anti-aging properties. It is better suited for a wider range of skin types and offers enhanced benefits overall despite its higher price. Therefore, while Product A is great for budget-conscious consumers with specific skin types, Product B is more effective for those looking for a more potent serum with additional skin benefits.",
  "recommendation": "For users with oily or combination skin looking for a budget-friendly option, Product A (GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum) is recommended. For those with normal, dry, or combination skin who seek a more potent serum with multiple benefits, Product B (Radiance Plus Vitamin C Serum) is the better choice."
